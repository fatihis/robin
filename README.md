# Robin serverless e-commerce application

## Introduction

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app),  using the [Tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

I am trying to build an serverless e-commerce website that only have hosting expenses for site, not any API. I am going to try to get user orders by free-to-use API's with having any building phase. Products will be fetched from local JSON file. Website is completely responsive, I have used tailwind.css for development.

## Available Scripts

### `yarn start`
